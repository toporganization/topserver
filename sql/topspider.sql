It was time to take note, he said, when \"grim instances of violence hit at...established values which are at the core of our nationhood,\"\r\nA respect for the past was an essential ingredient of nationalism, he said, adding, \"Our finest inheritance, the institutions of democracy, ensure to all citizens justice, equality, and gender and economic equity.\"The President said to complain, to demand, to rebel. \"This too is a virtue of democracy. But let us also applaud what our democracy has achieved. With investments in infrastructure, manufacturing, health, education, science and technology, we are positioning ourselves well for achieving a higher growth rate which will in the next ten to fifteen years help us eliminate poverty,\" he said.\r\nThe President said January 26, 1950, when the Republic was born and Constitution was adopted, it saw the culmination of heroic struggle of an extraordinary generation of leaders who overcame colonialism to establish the world\'s largest democracy.\r\n\"They pulled together India\'s amazing diversity to build national unity, which has brought us so far. The enduring democratic institutions they established have given us the gift of continuity on the path of progress,\" he said.\r\nThe President also touched upon the issue of dialogue with Pakistan, pointing out that terror and talks cannot go hand in hand.\r\nNations, he pointed out, will never agree on everything. \"But the challenge today is existential. If outlaws are able to unravel borders, then we are heading towards an age of chaos... We cannot discuss peace under a shower of bullets.\"                \''),(3,'\'The Saudi Debt Secret That US Treasury Has Kept For 41 Years\'','\'\r\n                    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        It\'s a secret of the vast U.S. Treasury market, a holdover from an age of oil shortages and mighty petrodollars: Just how much of America\'s debt does Saudi Arabia own?\r\nBut now that question -- unanswered since the 1970s, under an unusual blackout by the U.S. Treasury Department -- has come to the fore as Saudi Arabia is pressured by plunging oil prices and costly wars in the Middle East.\r\nIn the past year alone, Saudi Arabia burned through about $100 billion of foreign-exchange reserves to plug its biggest budget shortfall in a quarter-century. For the first time, it\'s also considering selling a piece of its crown jewel -- state oil company Saudi Aramco. The signs of strain are prompting concern over Saudi Arabia\'s outsize position in the world\'s largest and most important bond market.A big risk is that the kingdom is selling some of its Treasury holdings, believed to be among the largest in the world, to raise needed dollars. Or could it be buying, looking for a port in the latest financial storm? As a matter of policy, the Treasury has never disclosed the holdings of Saudi Arabia, long a key ally in the volatile Middle East, and instead groups it with 14 other mostly OPEC nations including Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Nigeria. For more than a hundred other countries, from China to the Vatican, the Treasury provides a detailed breakdown of how much U.S. debt each holds.\r\n\"It\'s mind-boggling they haven\'t undone it,\" said Edwin Truman, the former Treasury assistant secretary for international affairs during the late 1990s, and now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Because relations were rocky and the U.S. needed their oil, the Treasury \"didn\'t want to offend OPEC. It\'s hard to justify this special treatment for OPEC at this point.\"\r\nFor its part, the Treasury \"aggregates data where more detailed reporting might disclose the positions of individual holders,\" spokeswoman Whitney Smith said in an email.\r\nWhile that position is consistent with the International Investment and Trade in Services Survey Act, which governs disclosures of investments made by foreign persons and governments, and shields individuals in countries where Treasuries are narrowly held, it hasn\'t kept the Treasury from disclosing figures for a whole host of other countries -- large and small.\r\nThey range from the $3 million stake held by the island nation of the Seychelles, to the $69.7 billion investment from the oil-producing economy of Norway, and those of China and Japan, which are both in excess of $1 trillion.\r\nRepresentatives for the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, known as SAMA, and the nation\'s finance ministry declined to comment.\r\nApart from the kingdom itself, only a handful of Treasury officials, and those at the Federal Reserve who compile the data on their behalf, have a clear picture of Saudi Arabia\'s U.S. debt holdings and whether they\'re rising or falling.\r\nFor everyone else, it\'s a guessing game.\r\nThe special arrangement, born out of the 1973 oil shock following the Arab embargo, is just one small concession among many that successive U.S. administrations have made over the years to maintain America\'s strategic relationship with the Saudi royal family -- and its access to the kingdom\'s deep reserves of oil.\r\nThe exception extends to 12 other countries in the Treasury\'s oil-exporter group, all from the Middle East or Africa. Based on aggregate data released this week, that group has trimmed its stakes by a few billion dollars since March and held $289 billion as of November.\r\nBecause its holdings are believed to be the largest, Saudi Arabia\'s moves have drawn scrutiny, particularly as other central banks in emerging markets sell Treasuries to raise cash in defense of their currencies. (The Treasury doesn\'t break out private and public holdings, but its disclosures say about two- thirds of foreign holdings are held by official institutions such as central banks.)\r\nThose sales have had a small, but visible impact on America\'s funding costs. According to Deutsche Bank, selling by foreign central banks since March has added 0.3 percentage point to yields on 10-year Treasuries, which ended Thursday at 2.03 percent.\r\nSAMA\'s own figures show reserve assets held in foreign securities have fallen by a record $108 billion in 2015. The Saudi central bank, which doesn\'t disclose separate figures for Treasuries, owned $423 billion in overseas securities as of November.\r\n\"I come down on the side of thinking there should be more transparency,\" said Jeff Caughron, chief operating officer at Baker Group, which advises community banks with more than $45 billion in investments. But at the same time, \"the Treasury is constrained by political sensitivities and that comes into conflict with market participants that crave more transparency. It\'s an understandable conflict.\"\r\nAnd events in recent months, from President Barack Obama\'s landmark nuclear deal with Iran to Saudi Arabia\'s execution of a prominent Shiite cleric who challenged the royal family, underscore just how sensitive U.S.-Saudi relations have become. The longstanding rationale for the alliance has also been undercut by America\'s domestic oil boom, which has made it far less dependent on Saudi exports.\r\nWhatever the political considerations, some analysts speculate Saudi Arabia may actually be trying to hold onto its Treasuries as part of a strategy to bulk up on dollar assets amid the deepening turmoil in global financial markets.\r\n\"You need dollars if you\'re an oil producer, you want to make sure you have dollars on your balance sheet,\" said Sebastien Galy, Deutsche Bank\'s director of foreign-exchange strategy, who suggests SAMA could be raising cash by liquidating riskier investments such as stocks, real estate and private equity. Holding dollars also makes sense as a hedge against the plummeting price of oil, which is priced in the U.S. currency.\r\nFigures from SAMA suggest the kingdom might be reallocating some of its reserves into short-term, liquid assets to help the finance ministry meet budget commitments and defend its 30-year- old currency peg of 3.75 riyals to the dollar.\r\nThe central bank has increased foreign currencies and deposits held abroad by 7 percent in the first 11 months of 2015, while at the same time reducing foreign securities, consisting of equities and longer-term debt, by 20 percent.\r\nThat cash has become key. Oil\'s slump to less than $30 a barrel, from more than $100 two years ago, has eroded the petrodollar-fueled wealth that quadrupled per-capita income since the late 1980s and provided Saudi Arabia with the largess to offer free health care, gasoline subsidies and routine pay increases.\r\n\"When SAMA is required to raise liquidity for the Ministry of Finance, you\'d see deposits and cash go up and they\'d liquidate other assets,\" said Khalid Alsweilem, SAMA\'s former head of investment. \"They know when the Ministry of Finance will spend all their riyals. So they prepare certain amount of cash available based on such expectations.\"\r\nAlsweilem, who spent 20 years at SAMA and now advocates for fiscal reforms as a fellow at Harvard University\'s John F. Kennedy School of Government, says market watchers may overestimate how much money the central bank actually allocates to Treasuries.\r\nSAMA isn\'t a typical central bank because it acts as a quasi-sovereign wealth fund, he said. As such, it aims for higher returns as a buffer against falling oil revenue and invests in a wide array of risky assets, which explains why it has only recently started to become more transparent, Alsweilem said.\r\nTo hear Peterson Institute\'s Truman tell it, more clarity by central banks is long overdue -- particularly when it comes to the U.S. Treasury.\r\n\"In the old days at the Treasury and central banks, transparency wasn\'t the word of the day\" and politics made special treatment a non-issue, he said. Now, \"it\'s simply a legacy issue. You want to deal with it sooner or later.\"\r\nÂ© 2016 Bloomberg L.P.                \''),(4,'\'Yes, He Has ISIS Links, Arrested Mumbra Man\'s Wife Claims\'','\'Mumbai:Â                     The family of Muddabir Mushtaq Shaikh, it appears, was aware of his involvement with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Shaikh, 34, who was arrested from his Mumbra home on Friday at around 3 am, officers from the Maharashtra ATS and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) say, would often tell his family that he would be \"soon heading to Syria\".\r\nShaikh\'s wife Ujma, who is in her earlier 30s and holds a BCom degree, and her father Ahmed Miyan, a real-estate agent, had often counselled Shaikh against following the group\'s extremist ideologies. \"I would tell him that we had a family and two daughters to take care of, but he would neglect me saying he was part of an Islamic group that was working for a good cause,\" says Ujma. Ujma has moved out of her Reshma Apartment residence in Amrut Nagar where she lived with Shaikh and two daughters, and is put up with a relative.Shaikh has been accused of being primary recruiter for ISIS in India. He was produced at the special NIA court in Mumbai on Friday for transit remand. He will be produced at Patiala court on Monday. An IT professional, Shaikh was booked under Section 125 (waging war against any Asiatic power in alliance with the government) along with various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.\r\nUjma said her husband had been active with the ISIS for the past few months. \"But, I am aware that for the last one month, he was not very active. I told this to the investigating officers,\" she says, adding that the officers told her they were only taking her husband for interrogation.\r\nThe family, however, wasn\'t the only ones to know of Shaikh\'s ISIS sympathies.\r\nSources from the investigation agencies said that Shaikh would also try to radicalise people at the local Amrut Nagar mosque, where he would go for prayers five times a day. \"This we found out while interrogating Shaikh. He\'d tell the others that ISIS\'s ideology is the proper ideology and everyone should follow their way. Fortunately, no one entertained him,\" said an officer.\r\nYet, when Sunday mid-day visited the mosque that Shaikh frequented, we heard a different story. A maulana present there said, \"Shaikh was regular, but was a very quiet person. We were shocked to hear of his arrest. We thought he was a responsible man who took take care of his family. While we didn\'t speak to him much, we\'d often see him during prayers.\"\r\nInvestigation agencies, which have kept an eye on Shaikh for the last six months, say he had been active with the group for three years. \"Had anybody from the family, his wife or father-in-law or those he\'d meet at the mosque, informed us about Shaikh\'s approach towards the extremist group, we could have been able to de-radicalize him by getting him to meet Muslim scholars,\" added the officer who interrogated Shaikh for over three hours in the kitchen of his Mumbra residence.Living off ISIS money?\r\nSources claim that Shaikh would directly tell ISIS head Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi about his progress. \"He was active on social networking sites and would use the Internet to make calls. We have gathered evidence, including chat conversations, phone records and a hard disk, which prove his direct involvement with the group. We have also found sexual content, which we believe might have initially been used to lure him into working for the group,\" added the officer.\r\nThe officer added that till 18 months ago, Shaikh was working with a private firm in Goregoan, where he claims he was paid a monthly salary of Rs 50,000. He left for personal reasons.\r\n\"He said he had savings of R30 lakh to take care of his family and also some land, from which he was earning cash,\" added the officers who believe that Shaikh\'s real cash source was ISIS, who was funding him since he was their recruiter in India.                \''),(5,'\'Amit Shah Diary: Met Advani On Sunday, Will Visit Joshi Tomorrow\'','\'New Delhi:Â                     Hours after he was re-elected BJP president unchallenged, Amit Shah visited veteran leader LK Advani on Sunday night to \"seek his blessings,\" the party said. He will visit former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and senior leader Murli Manohar Joshi on Tuesday evening.\r\nMr Advani and Mr Joshi skipped Mr Shah\'s election and post-win celebrations at the BJP headquarters. Along with Mr Vajpayee, who has been unwell for some time now, the two seniors are part of what is called the Margdarshak Mandal or group of mentors, to which they were moved after Mr Shah took over as BJP chief in 2014.\r\nThe shift was seen to sideline the veterans who had always played a crucial role in the BJP\'s decision making till then; they lost their place in the BJP\'s parliamentary board, made up of the party\'s 13 top decision makers.Weeks ago, after the BJP\'s humiliating rout in the Bihar elections, Mr Advani and Mr Joshi had along with two other leaders offered a stinging critique of Mr Shah\'s leadership of the party.\r\nIt was seen as an attempt to scuttle Mr Shah\'s re-election, but the BJP effectively doused the rebellion.\r\nThis will be Mr Shah\'s first full term as BJP chief. He was so far completing the term of Rajnath Singh who became a minister in the Narendra Modi government in 2014.\r\nAmit Shah, 51, is seen as a close confidant of PM Modi and was credited with some of the high-points in the BJP\'s national election win in 2014, most notably its sweep of Uttar Pradesh, where it won 71 of 80 seats.\r\nTo win the UP assembly elections in 2017 is one of Mr Shah\'s big tasks ahead. He is also set to lead PM Modi\'s 2019 national campaign.\r\nOn the first day of his new term, the BJP chief was in West Bengal and attacked chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress.\r\nWest Bengal and four other states will vote in a few months.                \''),(6,'\'It Is Childish Of Bollywood To Speak Of Intolerance: Shatrughan Sinha\'','\'Jaipur:Â                     Bollywood actor and BJP lawmaker Shatrughan Sinha today said that it is childish for some in Bollywood to say there is intolerance in the country, and that he does not agree with them.\r\n\"A lot of people from the film industry brought up the issues of intolerance in haste, and it is childish to do so. I don\'t stand by them,\" Mr Sinha said during a session on the last day of the Jaipur Literature Festival.Mr Sinha said he agreed with fellow actor Kajol\'s remarks at the festival recently about there being \"no barrier, no line, no caste or creed in Bollywood.\"\r\n\"Only success is recognised here. I have never discriminated against who is a Bihari, a Hindu or a Muslim,\" said the actor-turned politician.\r\nFilmmaker Karan Johar on the inaugural day of the lit fest had said that he believed the \"talk about freedom of expression is the biggest joke in the world and democracy is the second biggest joke.\"\r\nMr Sinha also asked his biographer Bharathi S Pradhan to read out a portion from \"Anything But Khamosh: The Shatrughan Sinha Biography\" at the festival.\r\nThe portion from the book talked about how Sinha had during the 1992 Bombay riots helped the current Imam Bukhari\'s brother to escape to safety.\r\nResponding to a question from the audience over low attendance in Rajya Sabha of star members like actor Rekha and cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, the BJP MP said he would not have included such members in Parliament.\r\n\"I agree that such people shouldn\'t be brought to the Rajya Sabha for time pass. This low attendance has always been there with celebrities being inducted into the Rajya Sabha merely to increase the prestige of the House. I don\'t know how in today\'s time the Parliament\'s prestige is being increased,\" he said.\r\nÂ                 \''),(7,'\'On Rafale, India Put Itself In Tricky Situation: Foreign Media\'','\'\r\n                    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Nine months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi drastically scaled down the world\'s biggest fighter jet deal in a bid to quickly replenish India\'s aging air force with French warplanes, the two sides still haven\'t agreed on a price or delivery date.\r\nIn a joint briefing in New Delhi on Monday, Modi and French President Francois Hollande hailed the signing of a government- to-government deal for 36 Dassault Aviation Rafale warplanes. Hollande said the financial terms would be worked out in the \"coming days,\" while a joint statement said talks on price would be resolved \"as soon as possible.\"\r\n\"The key step has been made,\" Hollande said. \"In April it was a declaration. Today it\'s an agreement between two countries.\"\r\nFor India, it\'s another step in a quest to modernize its air force that first began in 2007. About one third of the country\'s air fleet is more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade, putting pressure on Modi to quickly acquire new warplanes to keep pace with neighbors China and Pakistan.\r\nIndia originally picked Dassault in 2012 to build 126 warplanes at an estimated cost of about $11 billion. As talks stalled over price and quality guarantees, Modi flew to France last April and sought to directly buy 36 fighter jets from the French government in a bid to speed things up.\r\nIndia and France have resolved what equipment, systems and weapons would go into the jet, a senior Indian defense official said this month, asking not to be identified because the information isn\'t public yet. The two sides have agreed on \"very large, non-financial areas,\" Indian Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar told reporters on Monday.\r\n\"There has considerable progress in these negotiations since last year,\" he said, calling the aircraft purchase an \"important but somewhat complicated issue.\"\r\nModi\'s move may have actually set India up for a protracted negotiation over price, according to Jon Grevatt, Asia-Pacific defense-industry analyst for IHS Jane\'s.\r\n\"India\'s put itself in a tricky situation,\" Grevatt said. \"It\'s declared its requirement for the Rafales. France knows India wants the Rafales. It\'s no surprise that price has become an issue.\"\r\nLast year, Modi and Hollande had announced the new terms would allow India to acquire planes as quickly as possible on better terms than those offered by Dassault, which had long struggled to find external buyers for its fighter. Nathalie Bakhos, a spokeswoman for Dassault Aviation, didn\'t immediately answer an email or a phone call seeking comment.\r\nYet weeks later, the Paris-based company won an order for 24 Rafale jets from Qatar, alleviating some of the pressure. It has also delivered at least three of 24 that it agreed to sell to Egypt last February, according to a July company presentation.\r\nTalks are also now advancing to sell Rafale fighter jets to Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates, according to a French official traveling with Hollande who asked not to be identified because he wasn\'t authorized to speak with the media. The French side now has more time to finalize the deal with India, the official said.\r\nHollande probably promised Modi a better deal last year in part because of \"the eagerness of French to sustain Rafale orders at that time,\" said Anurag Garg, a director of defense at Strategy&, a consulting group of PwC. The Rafale helps employ 7,000 people and 500 subcontractors, according to Dassault.\r\nThe sales to Egypt and Qatar \"may have increased France\'s negotiation power versus India, which needs these planes soon,\" Garg said.\r\nThe cost of the 36 jets is expected to exceed 600 billion rupees ($9 billion), the Economic Times reported earlier this month, citing unidentified \"authoritative sources.\" The final price would depend on the package to service the jets, it said.\r\nApart from the Rafale deal, both countries signed 13 other agreements including the manufacture of railway locomotives and cooperation between space agencies for India\'s next Mars mission.\r\nBureaucratic complexities and premature announcements have slowed the Rafale negotiations, according to Deba R. Mohanty, chairman of Indicia Research and Advisory, which advises companies on investing in India\'s defense industry.\r\n\"The new deal of 36 aircraft is still a bit away from eventual fruition,\" he said.                \''),(8,'\'Sikh Thrown Out Of Trump Rally.

Segolene Royal, prominent French politician and President Hollande\'s partner, accompanied them. Sources said the public were not allowed into the metro for about an hour as part of security measures.The leaders took the metro even as the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road and MG Road were expected to be shut down in preparation for the visit. In anticipation of the VIP cavalcade, heavy vehicles were also barred from a part of the National Highway 8.\r\nÂ \r\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi and Frence President Francois Hollande being welcomed at the inauguration of the ISA.\r\nThe ISA is specialised platform for cooperation among 121 sun drenched countries located predominantly in the tropical belt, who aim to increase the utilisation and promotion of solar energy. India had unveiled the solar alliance at the climate change summit. France had hailed it, calling the idea a \"game changer\".\r\n\"Countries that receive more than 300 days of sunlight must come together to form a solar alliance and group,\" the Prime Minister said at the inauguration today.\r\n\"ISA will work towards reducing global warming. This is a global and independent institution like the World Health Organisation and the United Nations.\"\r\nUnder the ISA, India plans to install 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022 and non-fossil fuel electricity generating systems, which will account for 40% of the energy capacity by 2030.\r\n\"Solar Alliance is India\'s gift to the world for combating climate change and France is proud to lead with you,\" President Hollande said today.\r\nThe French Development Agency, he said, will allocate 300 million euros towards developing solar energy over the next five years.

Mr Chandy denied any links to the swindle in his testimony to a retired high court judge.\r\nA couple named Biju Radhakrishnan and Saritha S Nair are accused of collecting crores from industrialists to whom they promised clean energy and solar panels. In 2013, it emerged that their scheme was a con-job. The opposition alleges that Mr Chandy\'s office and name were flaunted by the couple to land valuable contracts.\r\nThis is the first time that a Chief Minister in Kerala has been questioned by a judicial commission, news agency Press Trust of India reported.Late last year, Mr Radhakrishnan, in jail for his wife\'s murder, told the judge investigating the scandal that Mr Chandy personally accepted nearly five crores from him as a bribe. More money was paid to the Chief Minister\'s aides, he claimed. Mr Chandy, who is from the Congress, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, but he was forced to fire three important aides in his office in connection with the scam.\r\nThe Chief Minister has testified that the alleged swindle \"has not cost the exchequer even Rs 1.\" He said his relief fund received donations worth four lakhs from the couple charged with executing the solar scam.\r\nAhead of elections later this year, Mr Chandy\'s government is also being targeted for another scam -two of his ministers have quit over allegations that they helped 400 bars re-open after they had been ordered to close for sub-standard facilities.\r\nMr Radhakrishnan has testified that the Chief Minister offered to provide free land for a solar power project is he was guaranteed a chunk of profits.
